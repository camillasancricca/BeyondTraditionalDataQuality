Folders are organized as follows:

0 - ASSESSMENT includes the code used for computing the proposed quality metrics on the selected datasets.

1 - IMPACT includes the code used for implementing the experiments on the impact of the identified data characteristics on machine learning performance and fairness.

2 - DATASETS contains tables with additional details on the datasets used for the experiments.
